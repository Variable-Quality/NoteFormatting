# NoteFormatting

## Installation

1. Install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) or [sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/)
2. Create a project folder to hold the project files. If using git, then cd to that folder. If using sourcetree, click the + icon at the top left to add a new repository, then hit clone, and paste the file location into the Destination Path: text field.
3. After designating which folder to use, you want to now clone the repository. For git, simply type 'git clone https://github.com/Variable-Quality/NoteFormatting.git'.

4. For sourcetree, paste that link into the Source Path / URL of your repository settings and then **click out of the text box**. It wont update if your cursor is still inside the box. Once it verifies it as a git repository, you can clone it!


## How To Run

Simply run "RUNME.bat" and a GUI should open. As of right now you have to open config.ini with a text editor to see what delimiters are able to be removed, but that will be changing! Eventually.

## How To Use

Instead of copy and pasting unicode characters, just put a delimiter where the unicode character should go.

Delimiters are keywords that the program will look for and replace with the appropriate unicode symbol, according to the config.ini. An example will load up every time you run the program which will give you a basic example of how to use it. (I'll eventually make it so you're able to opt out of it being thrown up there every time)
