# NoteFormatting

## Installation

1. Install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) or [sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/)
2. Create a project folder to hold the project files. If using git, then cd to that folder. If using sourcetree, click the + icon at the top left to add a new repository, then hit clone, and paste the file location into the Destination Path: text field.
3. After designating which folder to use, you want to now clone the repository. For git, simply type 'git clone https://github.com/Variable-Quality/NoteFormatting.git'.

For sourcetree, paste that link into the Source Path / URL of your repository settings and then **click out of the text box**. It wont update if your cursor is still inside the box. Once it verifies it as a git repository, you can clone it!


## How To Run

Simply run "RUNME.bat" and a GUI should open. As of right now you have to open config.ini with a text editor to see what delimiters are able to be removed, but that will be changing! Eventually.
